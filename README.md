# Smart City Transportation Network Optimization Project

## Overview
This project implements a transportation optimization system for the Greater Cairo metropolitan area using various algorithmic concepts. The system focuses on optimizing road networks, routing, and traffic management through advanced graph algorithms and optimization techniques.

## Features
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) implementation for cost-efficient road network design
- Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for shortest path routing and emergency response
- Time-dependent shortest path algorithms for rush hour conditions
- Dynamic programming for public transit scheduling
- Traffic signal optimization using greedy algorithms
- Interactive visualization of the transportation network
- Simulation framework for different traffic scenarios

## Algorithm Implementations

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for road network optimization
- Considers constraints for critical facility access
- Time complexity: O(E log E) where E is the number of edges

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- Dijkstra's algorithm for static routing
- A* algorithm with time-dependent heuristics
- Time complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is vertices and E is edges

### Traffic Signal Optimization
- Greedy algorithm implementation for traffic light timing
- Considers traffic flow patterns and emergency vehicle preemption
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of intersections
